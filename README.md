Hangman is a word-geussing game that is played between two people.One person thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other person tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word to be guessed is represented by a series of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter in the word. The guessing player attempts to reveal the word by suggesting letters, one at a time.
